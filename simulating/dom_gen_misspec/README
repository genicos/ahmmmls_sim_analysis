First, we ran

./onlygenerate

This generated the simulated populations.
In order to run onlygenerate, the program SELAM must be downloaded,
and the binary must be placed in src/
Then we ran

./extwopieces

This runs ahmm_mls on the simulated populations. 
Then we ran

python3 gen_misspec_analysis.py

This produces a tcv with the graphable data
